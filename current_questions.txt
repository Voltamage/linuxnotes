is hardened linux depreciated
can i do full lvm with EFI Stub
can i transfer to usb fully with gentoo
how and where do my kernel bakcups go
what's the difference between /tmp and tmp/var
	do i mount both
	what permissions do i have to specify for these
should i make my grub partition ext2 or ext4
what's the difference between vfat and fat32 and which one should i be using for my boot partition
what do i need to compile into the kernel so it is compatible with LVM
what ssd trimming do i need to do
i believe grub2 cant read LVM, nor can brub 1.0
if tmpfs uses 50% ram, does that mean that i can only use 8gb of ram in other places?
is btrfs worth it
how do my chunk sizes work on a disk, and is 4MiB good and/or regular
does gentoo read MB or MiB by default
why do my partitions change size externally when i format them in different filetypes
